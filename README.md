## GTPB Course Pages

### Usage Instructions

1. Create contents using .md files in the pages folder. Use normal markdown format for your page contents.
2. The index.md page is the homepage for the website. Customise it as you would create a README.md file.
3. If using pdf or images upload them to the assets folder.
4. DO NOT erase or mess with any of the other folders and/or files without consulting with the organisation, as they are necessary for the website structure, layout and integrity.

### Deployment instructions

1. Edit the config.yml file to change the course name and url link.
2. When ready, copy the contents in the master branch to the gh-pages branch.
3. Make sure everything works properly and do your final corrections.
